# odin-recipes

Welcome to Odin Recipes! Here you will find three delicious recipes that I have gathered from around the web. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients, as well as step-by-step instructions to help you make each dish. As part of my learning of HTML through TheOdinProject, this mini project was assigned to me. I hope you enjoy the recipes!
